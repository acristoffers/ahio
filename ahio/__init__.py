"""@package ahio
ahio provides access to various I/O devices.

This package provides abstracted access to various digital and analogic I/O
devices, such as Arduino, Raspberry PI, MyRIO and PLC. It allows the developer
to write and read data from such devices without needing to worry about the
specifics of each device, and to easily switch devices without code
refactoring.

The functions in this package list and instantiate the drivers. For the driver
api, see `ahio.abstract_driver.AbstractDriver`. Driver metadata format can be
found in `ahio.abstract_driver.AbstractahioDriverInfo`
